# Multi-Dimenstional-Solar-Tracker
Solar energy is a clean, easily accessible and abundantly available alternative energy source in nature. Getting solar energy from nature is very beneficial for power generation. Although it is observed that solar energy cannot give enough power yields. Also the solar panels used in it are expensive. Using a fixed solar panels extract maximum energy only during 8AM noon to 7PM which results in less energy efficiency. Therefore, the need to improve the energy efficiency of solar panel through building a solar tracking system cannot be over-emphasized. The solar panels are kept perpendicular to the sun in order to get the maximum energy yield. The methodology applied here includes the use of Light Dependent Resistors (LDR), there are 4 LDRs kept in four planes, the intensity of light is compared and the pan-tilt moves in the direction of the LDR in which maximum light intensity is captured to track maximum energy. The solar panels are fixed with the LDRs and the as the pan tilt moves the position of the solar panels also changes. This mechanism uses 2 servo motors assembled to form a pan tilt for a 180Â° movement to get maximum power. The Arduino Uno R1 microcontroller is used to compare the light intensity of all the LDR and then it is supposed to move the pan-tilt accordingly. The result of this work has clearly shown that the tracking solar panel produces more energy compared to a fixed panel.
